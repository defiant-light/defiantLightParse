##The Big Idea
There's currently no platform to monetize machine-generated content in a way that capitalizes on the increadible volume possible using generative processes, and the near-zero marginal cost of creating an additional units of content. We've addressed this by using coinbase as a means of paying for the algorithmically-generated content (in this case poor imitations of Edgar Allan Poe poetry) and Mandrill to deliver that content to the customer.
